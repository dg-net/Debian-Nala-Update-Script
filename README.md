# Debian-Nala-Update-Script

This bash script uses nala to automatically run apt update, upgrade and autoremove.
Nala is an open source package manager alternative to APT for Debian/Ubuntu based distros. Nala provides a cleaner, 
organized GUI directly in the terminal for better readability, and package tracking.

To install Nala, type "sudo apt install nala" in the terminal.

To use this script, clone the update.sh file into any directory on your computer. Then give the file permission to
execute: "sudo chmod +x PATH/TO/FILE/update.sh"

Run the update file anytime by typing "PATH/TO/FILE/update.sh" in your terminal.
